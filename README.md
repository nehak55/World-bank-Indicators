# World-bank-Indicators
Comaprative analysis of world bank indicators 
This Study focuses on comparing the Food production Index, Total Reserves and Arms Imports of Spain with Germany, Morocco and Italy from 2004 to 2014.
INTRODUCTION
Food Production Index covers the food crops that are considered edible and that contains nutrients. Coffee and tea are excluded because, although edible, they have no nutritive value. FPI varies from region to region as it depends upon the climate, soil and water availability.
Total reserves comprise holdings of monetary gold, special drawing rights, reserves of IMF members held by the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange under the control of monetary authorities. The gold component of these reserves is valued at year-end (December 31) London prices. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
Arms Imports cover the supply of military weapons through sales, aid, gifts, and those made through manufacturing licenses. Data cover major conventional weapons such as aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, radar systems, missiles, and ships designed for military use. Excluded are transfers of other military equipment such as small arms and light weapons, trucks, small artillery, ammunition, support equipment, technology transfers, and other services.
